# NanoIsoform: Accurate identification of RNA isoforms using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing
This tool is to perform the downstream analysis on output from [NanoSplicer](https://github.com/shimlab/NanoSplicer), which is software we have developed for accurate identification of splice junction using nanopore data. 


Note: 
* In the current version, reads without strand information is discarded. This can potentially kept just for quantification
